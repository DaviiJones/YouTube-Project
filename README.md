# YouTube Project

This YouTube clone project is a collaborative effort between Anthony Huarneck, Davon Bridgett and Michael Caldwell. This project makes use of JavaScript, Html, Css, React & other programs/features. 

## How to Use

This program allows a user to search for any YouTube videos with the search bar. A user will input their search item into the search bar and press the "Submit" button. Once a search is submitted, eight different thumbnails of videos, along with their titles, related to the search input will render on the page beneath the search bar. 

A user can then click on any of the thumbnails to be brought to a "Show" page that will allow user to play the clicked video. A user will also have the ability to leave a comment by completing a comment form beneath video.

A user will have the ability to navigate to any page at any time by clicking on any of the links on the NavBar.
